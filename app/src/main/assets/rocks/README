# LuaRocks

Place LuaRocks in this folder, exactly how they are in the `lua/5.1/` folder of a Rocks Tree.
Subfolders are allowed, exactly as in a regular Rocks Tree.

Example:
```
/assets/rocks/
├── README (this file)
├── argparse.lua
├── arock.lua
├── socket
│   ├── http.lua
├── another_rock
│   ├── init.lua
```

For compiled C rocks (.so files), they must be placed in `/libs/<arch>/` in the APK, and named
`rock_<name>.so`. Dependencies such as `libssl.so` must be placed in the same folder.
C Rocks will *only* work when compiled specifically for SwMini! Binary releases, including those
built for Android or Termux, will not run properly!

For mod development and testing, a `rocks` folder can be created in `/Files/rocks/` or
`/ExternalFiles/rocks/`, and it will be used just like this folder. External rocks have precedence,
just like regular resource loading.

C rocks _must_ be in the APK, in the `/libs/<arch>/` folder, due to Android restrictions.
