# SwordigoMini Custom C Strings
# Created by ItsJustSomeDude

# Use this file to replace C strings in game.
# Useful for Translations, Achievement replacement, and modifying the title screen and other UIs.
# Format:
# Source=Replacement

# Spaces before and after the = are ignored:
# Source = Replacement

# Spaces are allowed in Replacement strings as normal:
# Source = A Replacement String

# For spaces in the Source string, use an underscore (_)
# Escaping the space also works.
# Source_String_with_Spaces = A Replacement String
# Source\ String\ with\ Spaces = A Replacement String

# For actual underscores in the Source String, use \\_
# Source\\_String\\_with\\_Underscores = A Replacement String

# If you want to have a Space at the beginning or end of the replacement, it must be escaped.
# (make sure the Space is included after the '\'.)
# Played_ = Touched\
# _ago. = \ in the past.
